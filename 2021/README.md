# Advent of Code 2021

These are my (probably terrible) solutions to the Advent of Code 2020 challenge

Each part is split into distinct blocks for **Part 1** and **Part 2** for clear readability, despite blatant code re-use

Languages found within:

- Python

As a disclaimer: these are not intended to be particularly decent ways to solve the challenges - and certainly not optimised in any thought out way. What will probably be evident here, is the (hopefully) logical way my brain works things out and translates to code.

(Yes, I stole this same readme from last year. shush.)
